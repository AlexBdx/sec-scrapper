# sec-scrapper
An Insight DE project.

The goal of this project is to parse 10-Ks, 10-Qs, 8-Ks from the SEC and run some mainstream NLP algorithm to study sentiments on it.
Results are expected to be compared against the VIX and see if they correlate.


## What is EDGAR (from the SEC's website)?
EDGAR is the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system used at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). EDGAR is the primary system for submissions by companies and others who are required by law to file information with the SEC. 

Containing millions of company and individual filings, EDGAR benefits investors, corporations, and the U.S. economy overall by increasing the efficiency, transparency, and fairness of the securities markets. The system processes about 3,000 filings per day, serves up 3,000 terabytes of data to the public annually, and accommodates 40,000 new filers per year on average.
