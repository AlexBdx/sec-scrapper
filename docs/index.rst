Welcome to secScraper's documentation!
========================================

This library provides a high level access to the SEC data. The main goal is to create virtual portfolios based on parsed 10-X filings.

Processing the reports is time consuming and the user should be ready to scale up/out the work in order to make iterations manageable.

View the GitHub repo for more information and sample code.
